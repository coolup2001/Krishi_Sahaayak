About app
To assist farmer on the part of :
    ▸Smart Farming
We have developed an android app that is highly farmer friendly and clean i.e easy to use with minimal text (Available in hindi).

Problem we solved :
•The lack of smart farming knowledge(such as amount of fertiliser to be used , type of  crop to be sown after the nutrient content and texture of soil changes ) among farmers

•Involvement of lots of middlemen and corruption that arises while selling the yield in  Mandi

•Less awareness with respect to the various beneficiary scheme existing for farmers

•Difficulties in soil health checking

•Right treatment of crops

•Rates of market
